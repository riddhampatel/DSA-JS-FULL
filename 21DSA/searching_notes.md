# Day 21: Binary Search Advanced

## Topics Covered:
- Binary Search on rotated arrays
- Find first/last occurrence
- Search in 2D arrays
- Advanced binary search patterns

## Key Concepts:

### 1. Rotated Array Search
Finding target in a rotated sorted array using modified binary search.

### 2. Boundary Search
Finding first and last position of target element in sorted array with duplicates.

## Time & Space Complexity:
- Time: O(log n)
- Space: O(1)
