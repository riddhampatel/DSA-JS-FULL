# Day 20: Linear & Binary Search

## Topics Covered:
- Linear Search Algorithm
- Binary Search Algorithm
- Binary Search on sorted arrays
- Search variations

## Key Concepts:

### 1. Linear Search
Iterating through each element to find a target value. Simple but O(n) time complexity.

### 2. Binary Search
Efficiently searching sorted arrays by eliminating half of remaining elements each iteration.

## Time & Space Complexity:
- Linear Search - Time: O(n), Space: O(1)
- Binary Search - Time: O(log n), Space: O(1)
